This file contains some basic Python code snippets for notable ML models and Explainability use cases.
These code samples can be used forked and use as a startin point for more elaborate ML modeling.
The main explainability techniques/tools addressed here are:
1- Shapley
2- LIME
3- IBM OpenScale
4- Permutation
5- Sensitivity Analysis
